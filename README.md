### Detailed description:
#### With this application, you can convert a folder to a phar archive and vice versa. This is my first application written in java (I wrote it on my phone and tested it there). I will try to support this app in the future!

### Future plans:
- [ ] Improve the code.
- [ ] Improve the transition between application tabs.
- [ ] Add a "Stub" change to the settings.
- [ ] Save the log in a separate file.
